Failure will never overtake me if my determination to succeed is strong enough.

1. I will greet this day with love in my heart.
2. I will persist until I succeed.
3. I am nature’s greatest miracle.
4. I will live this day as if it is my last.
5. Today I will be master of my emotions.
6. I will laugh at the world.
7. Today I will multiply my value a hundredfold.
8. I will act now.

好绝啊这本书，把耶稣诞生的故事揉进去了。第三位羊皮纸的传人还是扫罗，好绝，太绝了。
